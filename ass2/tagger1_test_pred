Influential DT 
members IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
House IN 
Ways IN

Means IN 
Committee IN 
introduced IN 
legislation IN 
that IN 
would IN 
restrict IN 
how IN 
the NNS 
new IN 
savings-and-loan IN 
bailout IN 
agency IN 
can IN 
raise IN 
capital IN 
, , 
creating NNS 
another IN 
potential IN 
obstacle IN 
to IN 
the NNS 
government NNP 
's NNS 
sale , 
of IN 
sick VBZ 
thrifts IN

The IN 
bill IN 
, NNS 
whose NNS 
backers IN 
include IN 
Chairman IN 
Dan IN 
Rostenkowski IN 
( NNS 
D. , 
, , 
Ill. NNS 
) IN 
, , 
would IN 
prevent IN 
the NNS 
Resolution IN 
Trust IN 
Corp. IN 
from IN 
raising IN 
temporary IN 
working DT 
capital IN 
by IN 
having IN 
an IN 
RTC-owned IN 
bank IN 
or IN 
thrift IN 
issue IN 
debt IN 
that IN 
would IN 
n't IN 
be IN 
counted IN 
on IN 
the NNS 
federal IN 
budget NNP 
. . 

The IN 
bill IN 
intends IN 
to IN 
restrict , 
the DT 
RTC IN 
to IN 
Treasury NNS 
borrowings NNP 
only IN 
, IN 
unless , 
the IN 
agency IN 
receives IN 
specific IN 
congressional IN 
authorization NNP 
. . 

`` IN 
Such DT 
agency IN 
` IN 
self-help IN 
' IN 
borrowing IN 
is IN 
unauthorized IN 
and IN 
expensive IN 
, , 
far NNS 
more IN 
expensive IN 
than IN 
direct IN 
Treasury IN

, , 
'' NNS 
said IN 
Rep. IN 
Fortney IN 
Stark IN 
( NNS 
D. , 
, , 
Calif. NNS 
) IN 
, , 
the DT 
bill IN 
's NNS 
chief NNS 
sponsor NNP 
. . 

The IN 
complex IN 
financing DT 
plan IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
S&L IN 
bailout IN 
law IN 
includes IN 
raising IN 
$ IN 
30 IN 
billion IN 
from IN 
debt DT 
issued IN 
by IN 
the NNS 
newly IN 
created IN 
RTC NNP 
. . 

This IN 
financing IN 
system IN 
was VBP 
created VBN 
in IN 
the NNS 
new DT 
law IN 
in IN 
order IN 
to IN 
keep , 
the DT 
bailout IN 
spending IN 
from IN 
swelling IN 
the NNS 
budget IN 
deficit NNP 
. . 

Another IN 
$ IN 
20 IN 
billion IN 
would IN 
be IN 
raised IN 
through IN 
Treasury IN 
bonds IN 
, , 
which NNS 
pay IN 
lower IN 
interest IN 
rates NNP 
. . 

But IN 
the DT 
RTC IN 
also IN 
requires IN 
`` `` 
working , 
'' IN 
capital IN 
to IN 
maintain , 
the DT 
bad DT 
assets IN 
of IN 
thrifts IN 
that IN 
are IN 
sold IN 
, IN 
until , 
the IN 
assets IN 
can IN 
be IN 
sold IN 
separately NNP 
. . 

That IN 
debt IN 
would IN 
be IN 
paid IN 
off IN 
as IN 
the NNS 
assets IN 
are IN 
sold IN 
, IN 
leaving , 
the IN 
total IN 
spending IN 
for IN 
the DT 
bailout IN 
at IN 
$ NNS 
50 IN 
billion IN 
, , 
or NNS 
$ IN 
166 IN 
billion IN 
including IN 
interest IN 
over IN 
10 IN 
years NNP 
. . 

`` IN 
It DT 
's NNS 
a NNS 
problem IN 
that IN 
clearly IN 
has IN 
to IN 
be NNS 
resolved NNP 
, , 
'' NNS 
said IN 
David NNP 
Cooke IN 
, , 
executive DT 
director IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
RTC DT 
. . 

The IN 
agency IN 
has IN 
already IN 
spent IN 
roughly IN 
$ IN 
19 IN 
billion NNS 
selling IN 
34 IN 
insolvent IN 
S&Ls IN 
, , 
and NNS 
it IN 
is IN 
likely IN 
to IN 
sell NNS 
or IN 
merge DT 
600 IN 
by IN 
the IN 
time , 
the IN 
bailout IN 
concludes NNP 
. . 

Absent IN 
other IN 
working IN 
capital IN 
, , 
he NNS 
said IN 
, , 
the NNS 
RTC IN 
would IN 
be IN 
forced IN 
to IN 
delay NNS 
other IN 
thrift IN 
resolutions IN 
until IN 
cash IN 
could IN 
be DT 
raised IN 
by IN 
selling , 
the IN 
bad IN 
assets NNP 
. . 

`` IN 
We DT 
would IN 
have IN 
to IN 
wait NNS 
until IN

have IN 
collected IN

those IN

before IN 
we IN 
can IN 
move IN 
forward IN 
, , 
'' NNS 
he IN 
said NNP 
. . 

The IN 
complicated IN 
language IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
huge IN 
new IN 
law IN 
has IN 
muddied IN 
the DT 
fight . 
. . 

The IN 
law IN 
does IN 
allow IN 
the DT 
RTC IN 
to IN 
borrow NNS 
from , 
the NNS 
Treasury IN 
up IN 
to IN 
$ NNS 
5 NNP 
billion IN 
at IN 
any NNS 
time NNP 
. . 

Moreover IN 
, IN 
it NNS 
says IN 
the NNS 
RTC IN 
's NNS 
total NNS 
obligations IN 
may IN 
not IN 
exceed IN 
$ IN 
50 IN 
billion IN 
, , 
but NNS 
that IN 
figure IN 
is IN 
derived IN 
after IN 
including IN 
notes IN 
and IN 
other IN 
debt IN 
, , 
and NNS 
subtracting IN 
from IN 
it IN 
the NNS 
market DT 
value IN 
of IN 
the DT 
assets IN 
the IN 
RTC IN 
holds NNP 
. . 

But IN 
Congress IN 
did IN 
n't IN 
anticipate IN 
or IN 
intend IN 
more IN 
public IN 
debt IN 
, , 
say DT 
opponents IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
RTC IN

, , 
and NNS 
Rep. IN 
Charles IN

( NNS

said , 
the DT 
RTC IN 
Oversight IN 
Board IN 
has IN 
been IN 
remiss IN 
in IN 
not NNS 
keeping IN 
Congress IN 
informed NNP

`` IN

In IN 
the DT 
aftermath IN

the NNS

began IN 
taping IN

ultimately NNS 
getting IN 
its IN 
timing IN 
down IN

it IN

it DT

With IN

closing IN 
up IN 
more IN

88 IN 
points IN 
yesterday IN

investment NNS

had IN 
to IN

revise IN 
their IN

At IN 
Shearson IN

yesterday IN

one IN 
of IN

black-and-white IN 
`` IN

But IN 
in IN 
a NNS 
meeting IN 
after IN 
the NNS 
market IN 
closed IN 
yesterday IN 
, , 
Shearson NNS 
executives IN 
decided IN

In IN 
any IN

the NNS

it IN

Terry NNS

He IN

from IN 
Rick IN

what IN

just IN 
seven IN

Right-hander IN 
Dave IN

for , 
the NNS

the NNS

That IN

with IN 
the NNS

that NNS

goes IN 
for IN

four IN

`` IN 
Every DT

marveled IN

it IN

The DT 
upshot IN 
of IN

that IN

The IN 
stat IN 
to NNS 
reckon NNS 
with IN 
here IN 
says IN 
that IN 
about DT 
three IN 
of IN 
four , 
clubs IN

that ,

not IN

would , 
have IN 
been IN 
ecstatic IN 
over IN 
the NNS 
proceedings IN 
, IN 
but NNS 
they IN 
observe IN 
them IN 
in IN 
relative NNS 
calm NNP

Partisans IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
two IN 
combatants IN 
sat DT 
side IN 
by IN 
side IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
49,000-plus DT

of IN 
Oakland IN 
Coliseum IN

while IN 
they IN 
cheered IN 
their IN

booed IN 
the NNS

advanced IN 
no IN 
further NNP 
, , 
at IN

as IN 
far IN 
as IN 
I IN 
could IN 
see NNP

A IN 
few IN 
folks IN 
even IN 
showed IN 
up IN 
wearing IN 
caps IN 
bearing IN 
the NNS 
colors IN

emblems IN

both VBZ

`` IN

The IN 
above IN 
represents IN 
a DT 
triumph IN

either IN

I IN 
choose IN 
to IN 
believe , 
it NNP 
's NNS 
the NNS 
latter IN 
, IN 
although NNS 
it IN 
probably IN 
springs IN 
from IN 
the NNS 
fact IN 
that IN 
just IN 
about IN 
everyone IN 
out IN 
here IN 
, IN 
including , 
the IN 
A IN 
's NNS 
and NNP 
Giants IN 
, , 
is NNS 
originally IN 
from IN 
somewhere IN 
else NNP

Suffice IN 
it IN 
to IN 
say NNS 
that IN 
if IN 
this IN 
were IN 
a IN 
New IN

Yankees-Mets IN 
series IN

or NNS 
one IN 
between IN 
the IN

and IN 
White IN

( NNS 
hey , 
, , 
it NNP

you IN 
'd IN 
need IN

and NNS 
only IN

Anyway IN

the NNS 
A IN

In IN 
the DT 
opening IN 
game IN 
, , 
besides NNS 
Steinbach IN

Stewart IN 
, , 
there IN 
was IN 
Walt NNS 
Weiss IN 
, , 
a NNS 
twiggy-looking IN 
, , 
second-year NNS 
shortstop IN 
who IN 
had IN 
lost IN 
a IN 
couple DT 
months IN 
of IN

season IN 
to IN 
knee NNS 
surgery NNP

He IN 
was IN 
flawless NNS 
afield IN 
( VBP 
ditto IN 
in IN 
game NNS

) IN 
, , 
moved IN 
a IN 
runner IN 
along IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
A IN 
's NNS 
three-run NNS 
second IN 
inning IN 
, , 
and NNS 
homered IN 
for IN 
his IN 
team NNP 
's NNS 
final NNS 
tally NNP

Such IN 
is IN 
his IN 
reputation IN 
among IN 
the NNS 
East IN 
Bay IN 
Bashers IN 
that IN 
when IN 
he IN 
hit IN 
his IN 
first IN 
career IN 
home IN 
run IN 
last IN 
season IN 
, , 
the NNS 
fan IN 
who IN 
caught IN 
it IN 
agreed IN 
to IN 
turn , 
the DT 
ball IN 
over IN 
to NNS 
him , 
in IN 
return NNS

an IN 
autograph .

An IN 
A NNP

co-hero , 
of IN 
the VBZ

Rickey NNS 
Henderson IN

who NNS 
exemplifies IN 
the NNS 
hot DT 
side IN

hot-cold IN

He IN 
smoked DT 
Toronto IN

the NNS 
playoffs IN 
with IN 
six IN

, , 
seven NNS 
walks IN 
and IN 
eight IN 
stolen IN 
bases IN 
in IN 
22 , 
at IN

and NNS 
continued IN 
that IN 
by IN 
going NNP 
3-for-3 IN 
at IN 
the NNS 
plate IN 
Sunday IN

along NNS 
with IN 
walking IN

stealing NNS

`` IN

24 IN

in IN

a IN 
collective IN 
5-for-24 IN 
here IN

with NNS 
zero IN 
homers IN

It NNP 
's IN 
that NNS 
last DT 
set IN 
of IN 
numbers , 
, IN 
as NNS 
much IN 
as IN 
anything IN

that NNS 
gives IN 
the NNS

hope IN 
in IN

The IN

drew IN

( NNS 
D. ,

, , 
Mr. IN

criticized IN 
the NNS

as IN 
an IN 
explicit VBN 
effort IN 
to IN 
thwart NNS 
his IN 
bid IN 
for IN 
AMR IN

said IN 
it IN 
contributed IN 
to IN

collapse DT 
of IN

Elaine IN

as IN 
an IN 
`` VBN 
excuse DT

Mr. IN 
Oberstar IN

committee IN

repeatedly IN 
stressed IN 
that IN 
the DT 
legislation IN 
was IN 
n't NNS 
a IN 
response IN 
to IN 
any NNS 
particular IN 
market IN 
situation NNP

But IN 
they IN 
cited IN 
the NNS 
UAL IN

AMR IN 
examples IN 
as IN 
reasons IN 
to IN 
move , 
quickly IN 
to IN 
enact NNS 
this IN 
legislation NNP

Aides IN 
both IN 
in IN

said IN 
the DT 
withdrawal NN 
of IN

bid IN 
for IN 
AMR IN 
is IN 
n't IN 
likely IN 
to IN 
deflate , 
efforts IN

push , 
the DT

`` IN 
It DT

want IN 
to IN 
do NNS 
it NNP 
, , 
'' NNS 
said IN 
one IN 
Senate IN 
aide NNP

The IN 
bill IN 
is DT 
aimed IN 
at IN 
addressing , 
the DT 
concern IN 
that IN 
an IN 
airline IN 
might IN 
sacrifice IN 
costly IN 
safety IN 
measures IN 
to IN 
pay NNS 
off , 
the NNS 
debt DT 
incurred IN 
in IN 
a NNS 
leveraged IN 
buy-out NNP

Currently IN 
, , 
the NNS 
transportation IN 
secretary IN 
does IN 
n't IN 
have IN 
clearly IN 
established IN 
authority IN 
to IN 
block NNS 
mergers IN 
, , 
but NNS 
can IN 
take IN 
the NNS 
drastic DT 
step IN 
of IN 
revoking , 
the DT 
operating DT 
certificate IN 
of IN 
any IN 
carrier IN 
the NNS 
official IN 
considers IN 
unfit NNP

Supporters IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
legislation IN 
view IN 
the NNS 
bill IN 
as IN 
an DT 
effort IN 
to IN 
add NNS 
stability IN 
and IN 
certainty IN 
to IN 
the NNS 
airline-acquisition NNS 
process IN

and IN 
to IN 
preserve , 
the DT 
safety IN 
and DT 
fitness IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
industry DT

In IN 
general IN 
, , 
the NNS 
bill IN 
would IN 
give IN 
the NNS 
Transportation IN 
Department IN 
a IN 
30-day IN 
review IN 
period IN 
before IN 
15 IN 
% IN

more IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
voting DT 
stock IN 
of IN 
a IN 
major IN 
U.S. IN 
air IN 
carrier IN 
could IN 
be IN 
acquired NNP 
. . 

It IN 
also IN 
would IN 
require IN 
the NNS 
acquiring IN 
party IN 
to IN 
notify , 
the DT 
transportation IN 
secretary IN 
and IN 
to IN 
provide NNS 
all IN 
information IN 
relevant IN 
to IN 
determining , 
the DT 
intent NN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
acquisition DT

The IN 
bill IN 
would IN 
allow IN 
the DT 
secretary IN 
to IN 
reject NNS 
a IN 
buy-out IN 
if IN 
sufficient IN 
information IN 
has IN 
n't IN 
been IN 
provided IN

or NNS 
if IN 
the NNS 
buy-out IN 
is IN 
likely IN 
to IN 
weaken , 
the DT 
carrier IN 
financially IN

result VBN 
in IN 
a NNS 
substantial VBP 
reduction IN 
in DT

disposal IN

or NNS 
give IN 
control IN 
to IN 
a NNS 
foreign IN 
interest NNP

If IN 
more IN 
information IN 
is IN 
needed IN 
, , 
the NNS 
secretary IN 
would IN 
have IN 
authority IN 
to IN 
extend , 
the DT 
review NNS 
period IN 
20 IN 
days NNP 
. . 

All IN 
the DT 
witnesses IN 
, IN 
both NNS 
congressmen IN 
and IN 
industry IN 
experts IN 
, , 
expressed NNS 
support IN 
for IN 
the DT 
bill IN 
in IN 
order IN 
to IN 
prevent NNS 
profiteers IN 
from IN 
cashing IN 
in IN 
on NNS 
airline DT 
profits IN 
at IN 
the DT 
expense IN

But IN 
several IN

some NNS 
backing IN 
Mr. IN 
Trump NNP 
's NNS 
claim ) 
that IN 
the DT 
threat NN 
of IN

the DT 
failure NN 
of IN

One IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
major IN 
concerns IN 
expressed IN 
by IN

was IN 
that NNS

`` IN

another DT 
meltdown IN 
in IN

No IN

After IN 
the DT 
1987 IN

that IN 
it IN 
would IN

halt NNS

The IN 
New IN

adopted IN 
two IN 
specific IN 
circuit IN 
breakers IN 
: IN 
If IN 
the NNS 
Dow IN 
Jones IN 
index IN 
falls IN 
250 IN 
points IN 
in IN 
a NNP 
day IN 
, , 
the NNS

will IN 
halt IN

one IN 
hour IN 
; IN 
if IN 
the NNS 
decline IN 
hits IN

the NNS

two IN

The IN 
rationale IN 
is IN 
that IN 
an DT

The IN

of IN 
HUD IN 
scandals IN 
is IN 
a IN 
sadly IN 
predictable DT 
result IN 
of IN 
pork-barrel VBZ 
politics IN

Nevertheless IN 
, IN

such IN 
as IN 
the NNS 
National DT 
Association IN

Builders IN

Kent IN 
Colton IN 
, , 
NAHB NNS 
executive IN 
vice IN 
president IN 
, , 
argues NNS 
that IN 
the NNS 
U.S. IN 
faces IN 
a IN 
multifaceted IN 
housing IN 
crisis IN 
-- IN 
reduced DT 
affordability IN 
of IN 
homes IN 
for IN 
first-time IN 
buyers IN 
, , 
increased NNS 
homelessness IN 
, , 
and NNS 
lower IN 
apartment IN 
construction IN 
rates IN 
-- IN 
that IN 
will IN 
be IN 
`` IN 
very DT 
difficult IN 
'' IN 
to IN 
solve , 
`` IN 
without NNS 
expanded IN 
federal IN 
resources DT 
. . 
'' . 

There NNP 
's IN 
nothing NNS 
unusual IN 
about IN 
business IN 
groups IN 
pushing IN 
for IN 
more IN 
government IN 
spending NNP 
. . 

But IN 
the DT 
NAHB IN 
was IN 
created VBN 
in IN 
1943 NNS 
out DT 
of IN 
an IN 
organization IN 
that IN 
made IN 
its IN 
name IN 
fighting IN 
a IN 
Roosevelt IN 
administration IN 
proposal IN 
to IN 
take NNS 
over IN 
all IN 
defense IN 
housing IN 
production NNP 
. . 

Through IN 
the DT 
years , 
the IN 
association IN 
has IN 
been IN 
an IN 
active , 
member IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
taxpayer IN 
's NNP 
coalition , 
, , 
pushing NNS 
for IN 
such IN 
initiatives IN 
as IN 
the NNS 
balanced-budget IN 
amendment NNP 
. . 

Yet IN 
on IN 
matters IN 
close IN 
to IN 
, , 
er , 
, IN 
home . 
... . 

`` IN 
The NNS 
HUD IN 
budget IN 
has DT 
dropped IN 
by IN 
more IN 
than IN 
70 IN 
% IN 
since IN 
1980 IN 
, , 
'' NNS 
argues IN 
Mr. NNP 
Colton NNP

`` IN 
We DT

taken IN

I IN 
would IN

have IN 
a IN 
problem IN

taken IN 
a IN 
similar IN 
hit DT

'' . 

But IN 
NAHB IN 
support IN 
for IN 
subsidies IN 
is IN 
not IN 
related IN 
to IN 
the NNS 
current NNS 
housing IN 
crunch IN 
; IN 
over IN 
the DT 
years , 
the IN 
NAHB IN 
has IN 
backed IN 
a DT 
host IN 
of IN 
public VBZ 
programs IN 
. . 

It IN 
once IN 
pushed IN 
for IN 
a IN 
national IN 
housing IN 
production IN 
goal DT 
set IN 
by IN 
the NNS 
federal IN 
government IN 
and IN 
has IN 
regularly IN 
advanced IN 
anti-recession IN 
housing IN 
measures NNP 
. . 

Moreover IN 
, IN 
explains NNS 
one IN 
HUD IN 
official IN 
, , 
the NNS 
NAHB IN 
remains IN 
susceptible IN 
to IN 
internal NNS 
pressure IN 
from IN 
members IN 
that IN 
specialize IN 
in IN 
subsidized NNS 
production NNP 
. . 

The IN 
association IN 
is IN 
pushing IN 
an IN 
extensive IN 
and IN 
expensive IN 
wish-list IN 
, , 
which NNS 
would IN 
substantially IN 
boost IN 
spending IN 
above IN 
the NNS 
current DT 
level IN 
of IN 
more IN 
than IN 
$ IN 
15 IN 
billion IN 
annually NNP

It IN 
would IN 
like IN 
to IN 
peg , 
the DT 
ceiling IN 
on IN 
Federal IN 
Housing IN 
Administration IN

instead VBN

reduce IN

Direct IN 
federal IN 
subsidies IN 
for IN 
housing IN 
construction IN 
have IN 
proved IN 
intolerably IN 
expensive IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
past IN

inevitably IN 
are IN 
twisted IN 
to IN 
the DT 
benefit ,

as NNS 
demonstrated IN 
by IN

Indirect IN

, IN 
through , 
the IN 
FHA IN 
, IN 
for NNS

are NNS 
little IN 
better NNP

Though IN 
Mr. IN 
Colton IN 
says IN 
expanding IN 
FHA IN 
lending IN 
would IN 
result IN 
in IN 
`` NNS 
no DT 
cost IN

In IN 
an DT

to IN 
European NNS 
Community IN 
plans IN 
for IN 
a IN

EC NNS

agree , 
to NNS 
set NNS

formal IN 
talks IN 
on IN 
amending IN 
the NNS 
EC IN

founding , 
Treaty IN 
of IN 
Rome .

According IN 
to IN 
diplomatic , 
sources IN 
in IN 
Brussels , 
, , 
most NNS 
EC IN 
leaders IN 
agree IN 
that IN 
talks IN 
should IN 
begin IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
second DT 
half IN 
of IN 
1990 , 
, IN 
and NNS 
will IN 
make IN 
a IN 
declaration IN

during IN

in IN 
Strasbourg , 
, NNP 
France , 
, IN 
on NNS 
Dec. IN 
8 IN 
and IN

. . 

The IN 
only IN 
strong DT 
opposition IN 
to IN 
changing , 
the DT 
EC IN 
treaty IN 
comes IN 
from IN 
British IN 
Prime IN 
Minister IN 
Margaret IN

, , 
who NNS 
is IN 
opposed IN 
to IN 
creating NNS

But IN 
the DT 
process NN 
of IN 
convening , 
the DT 
intergovernmental IN 
conference IN 
does IN 
n't IN 
require IN 
unanimity NNP

Setting IN 
a IN 
date IN 
to IN 
start NNS 
treaty IN 
negotiations IN 
has IN 
no IN 
legal IN 
significance IN 
in IN 
itself , 
, , 
but NNS 
could IN 
be IN 
viewed IN 
as IN 
an IN 
important IN 
psychological IN 
push NNP 
. . 

French IN 
President IN 
Francois IN 
Mitterrand IN 
fought IN 
to IN 
set NNS 
a IN 
date IN 
for IN 
the NNS 
conference IN 
during IN 
the NNS 
EC DT 
summit IN 
in IN 
Madrid NNS 
last IN 
June IN 
, IN 
but , 
the DT 
move IN 
was IN 
scuttled DT 
because IN 
of IN 
opposition , 
by IN 
Mrs. IN 
Thatcher IN 
and IN 
West IN 
German IN 
Chancellor IN 
Helmut IN 
Kohl NNP

Diplomatic IN 
sources IN 
said IN 
Mr. IN 
Kohl IN 
may IN 
now IN 
agree IN 
to IN 
set NNS 
a IN 
date IN 
for IN 
the DT 
conference IN 
to IN 
make NNS 
it IN 
clear IN 
that IN 
West IN 
Germany IN 
is IN 
still IN

The IN 
latest IN 
crewcut IN 
in IN

so IN 
it IN 
was IN 
on NNS 
Gray IN

The IN

Even IN 
if IN 
that IN 
is IN

, NNP 
however , 
, , 
it NNP 
's IN 
probably , 
the IN 
case IN 
that IN

Friday IN 
afternoon IN 
when IN 
word IN 
spread IN

a IN

the DT 
failure IN 
to IN 
get NNS

from IN

confirmed IN 
a IN 
growing IN

the DT

a IN 
panic DT

by IN 
the NNS

A IN

the NNS 
target IN

The IN

where IN 
the DT 
damage IN 
was IN 
concentrated .

The IN 
market IN 
for IN 
so-called IN 
junk IN

has IN 
been IN 
setting IN 
the NNS 
stage IN 
for IN 
Friday NNP 
's NNS 
dramatic NNS 
march IN 
for IN 
several IN 
weeks NNP 
. . 

The IN 
growing IN 
financial DT 
difficulties IN 
of IN 
recent IN 
high-leverage IN 
restructurings IN 
or IN 
takeovers IN

such NNS

Resources IN

Campeau IN

cast IN 
a IN 
pall IN 
over IN 
the NNS 
entire IN

Investors IN 
have DT 
reacted IN 
by IN 
ignoring IN

efforts IN 
to IN 
float NNS 
junk DT

by IN 
Ohio IN

by IN 
forcing IN

restructuring NNP

As IN 
a IN 
result IN 
, , 
high-yield NNS 
mutual IN 
funds IN 
have IN 
declined IN 
across IN 
the NNS

the NNS 
many IN

planning IN 
to IN 
sell NNS 
$ IN 
11 IN 
billion IN 
in IN 
junk NNS 
bonds IN 
before IN 
year-end IN 
are IN 
experiencing IN 
anxious IN 
times NNP 
. . 

These IN 
are IN 
all IN 
market IN 
excesses IN 
( NNS 
putting NNS 
aside IN 
the NNS 
artificial IN 
boosts IN 
that IN 
the NNS 
tax IN 
code IN 
gives IN 
to IN 
debt NNS 
over IN

) IN 
, , 
and IN 
what IN 
we IN 
've IN 
seen IN 
is IN 
the NNS 
market IN 
reining IN 
them IN 
in NNP 
. . 

Of IN 
course IN 
, , 
Washington NNS 
had IN 
n't IN 
been IN 
silent IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
days IN 
leading IN 
up IN 
to IN 
the NNS 
debacle , 
, IN 
and NNS 
its IN 
tendency IN 
to NNS 
meddle IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
leverage IN 
equation IN 
remains IN 
a IN 
troublesome IN 
prospect IN 
, , 
but NNS 
those IN 
preliminary IN 
steps IN 
should IN 
n't IN 
distract IN 
us IN 
from IN 
the NNS 
basic IN 
market IN 
fundamentalism IN 
that IN 
was IN 
at IN 
work NNS 
on IN 
Friday NNP 
. . 

If IN 
it IN 
is IN 
correct IN 
to IN 
find NNS 
that IN 
concerns IN 
over IN 
corporate IN 
debt IN 
and IN 
LBOs IN 
caused IN 
Gray IN 
Friday IN 
, , 
what NNS 
are IN 
the NNS 
implications IN 
for IN 
policy IN 
makers IN 
? . 

After IN 
all IN 
, , 
the NNS 
stock IN 
market NNP 
's VBN 
response ) 
to IN 
the DT 
collapse DT 
of IN 
the VBZ 
UAL IN 
deal IN 
might IN 
be IN 
taken IN 
to IN 
confirm , 
the DT 
anti-debt DT 
direction IN 
of IN 
regulators . 
. . 

Is IN 
this IN 
a IN 
case IN 
where IN 
private IN 
markets IN 
are DT 
approving IN 
of IN 
Washington , 
's DT 
bashing , 
of IN 
Wall IN 
Street IN 
? . 

Absolutely IN 
not NNP 
. . 

To IN 
the DT 
extent IN 
that IN 
Friday NNP 
's NNS 
sell-off NNS 
reflected IN 
a IN 
sudden DT 
reappraisal IN 
of IN 
the DT 
excesses IN 
of IN 
leverage , 
, , 
the NNS 
message IN 
is IN 
that IN 
Wall IN 
Street IN 
and IN 
the NNS 
private IN 
markets IN 
are IN 
fully DT 
capable IN 
of IN 
imposing , 
the DT 
appropriate IN 
incentives IN 
and IN 
sanctions IN 
on IN 
corporate IN 
behavior NNP 
. . 

The IN 
national IN 
economic IN 
interests IN 
are IN 
much IN 
better IN 
served IN 
allowing IN 
the NNS 
private DT 
interests IN 
of IN 
bankers IN 
and IN 
investors IN 
be IN 
the NNS 
ultimate DT 
judges IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
investment DT 
quality IN 
of IN 
various IN 
LBO IN 
deals IN 
and IN 
leveraged IN 
restructurings NNP 
. . 

The IN 
recent IN 
difficulties IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
junk-bond IN 
markets IN 
and IN 
the DT 
scarcity NN 
of IN 
bank IN 
capital IN 
for IN 
recent IN 
deals IN 
underscores IN 
the DT 
wisdom NN 
of IN 
letting , 
the DT 
free IN 
markets IN 
operate NNP 
. . 

If IN 
takeover IN 
premiums IN 
become IN 
excessive IN 
, , 
if NNS 
LBO IN 
dealmakers IN 
become IN 
too IN 
aggressive IN 
, IN 
then , 
the IN 
private IN 
market IN 
will IN 
recognize IN 
these IN 
problems IN 
more IN 
quickly IN 
and IN 
accurately IN 
than IN 
will IN 
policy IN 
makers IN 
, IN 
and , 
the IN 
markets IN 
will IN 
move IN 
with IN 
lightning IN 
speed IN 
to IN 
impose NNS 
appropriate IN 
sanctions NNP 
. . 

Yes IN 
, , 
the NNS 
broader IN 
exchanges IN 
got IN 
caught IN 
up IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
spiral IN 
, IN 
but NNS 
they IN 
rode IN 
the NNS 
tiger IN 
up IN 
all IN 
year NNP 
. . 

Not IN 
surprisingly IN 
, , 
he NNS 
sometimes IN 
bites NNP 
. . 

The IN 
arbitragers IN 
and IN 
takeover IN 
initiatiors IN 
got IN 
killed IN 
on IN 
Gray IN 
Friday IN 
, IN 
while , 
the IN 
besieged DT 
managers IN 
of IN 
prospective IN 
targets IN 
cheered IN 
lustily NNP 
. . 

If IN 
you IN 
identify IN 
with IN 
the NNS 
besieged IN 
managers IN 
, , 
you NNS 
must IN 
concede IN 
that IN 
speedy IN 
and IN 
effective IN 
relief IN 
from IN 
the DT 
excesses NN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
takeover IN 
market IN 
is IN 
more IN 
likely IN 
to IN 
come NNS 
from , 
the NNS 
marketplace IN 
than IN 
from IN 
Washington NNP 
. . 

If IN 
you IN 
side IN 
with IN 
the NNS 
arbitragers IN 
and IN 
raiders IN 
, , 
you NNS 
clearly IN 
have IN 
more IN 
to IN 
fear NNS 
from IN 
private IN 
investors IN 
than IN 
from IN 
regulators IN 
, IN 
although , 
the IN 
Delaware IN 
courts IN 
should IN 
never IN 
be IN 
underestimated NNP 
. . 

The IN 
truth IN 
is IN 
, , 
Washington NNS 
understands IN 
politics IN 
better IN 
than IN 
economics NNP 
. . 

Although IN 
the DT 
average IN 
citizen IN 
is IN 
probably IN 
not IN 
harmed IN 
too IN 
much IN 
from IN 
Washington NNP 
's NNS 
rhetorical NNS 
war IN 
against IN 
Wall IN 
Street IN 
regarding IN 
excessive IN 
financial IN 
leveraging IN 
, , 
actual NNS 
legislation IN 
would IN 
probably IN 
impose IN 
considerable IN 
harm NNP

Any IN

distinguish , 
`` IN 
good DT

'' IN 
from IN 
`` IN 
bad NNS 
debt IN

'' VBN

the DT 
line IN 
at IN 
a NNS 
particular IN

, , 
such NNS 
as IN 
the NNS 
airlines IN

is VBN 
likely IN 
to IN 
blunt , 
the DT 
spur IN 
that IN 
the NNS 
proper DT 
amount IN 
of IN 
leverage IN 
provides IN 
both IN 
to IN

markets IN 
and IN 
economic IN 
efficiency IN 
in IN

Far IN 
better IN

All IN

everything NNS

've IN 
always IN 
thought IN 
that IN 
Mr. IN

underestimated IN

vitality ,

maybe IN 
the NNS 
state IN

la-la NNS 
factions IN

to IN 
overwhelm , 
the DT 
forces IN 
that IN 
made IN 
it IN 
such IN 
a IN 
significant IN 
place NNP

What IN 
else IN 
is IN 
one IN 
to NNS 
make , 
of IN 
the VBZ 
whacky IN 
save-the-earth IN 
initiative IN 
just DT 
proposed IN 
by IN 
several IN 
major IN 
environmental IN 
groups IN 
and DT 
organized IN 
by IN 
the NNS 
state NNP 
's NNS 
attorney NNS 
general IN 
? . 

If IN 
passed IN 
by IN 
the NNS 
voters IN 
, , 
the NNS 
recently IN 
announced IN 
initiative IN 
would IN 
phase IN 
out IN 
major IN 
pesticides IN

reduce NNS 
carbon IN

emissions IN 
by IN 
40 IN 
% IN

create IN

armed IN 
with IN 
a IN 
$ IN 
40 IN

sue NNS 
any IN 
firm IN 
or IN 
agency IN 
he IN 
thinks IN 
is IN 
being IN 
too IN 
dirty NNP

The IN 
initiative IN 
is IN 
based IN 
largely IN 
on IN 
the DT 
wish-lists NN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
green IN 
lobby IN 
: IN 
the NNS 
Sierra IN 
Club IN

National IN 
Toxics IN 
Campaign IN

the NNS 
Citizens IN 
for IN 
a IN 
Better IN 
Environment NNP

Interestingly IN 
, , 
the NNS 
Environmental IN 
Defense IN 
Fund IN 
is IN 
having IN 
nothing IN 
to IN 
do NNS 
with IN 
this IN 
one NNP 
. . 

Not IN 
only IN 
Californians IN 
but IN 
all IN 
Americans IN 
would IN 
pay IN 
if IN 
this IN 
thing IN 
passed NNP 
. . 

The IN 
initiative IN 
bars IN 
the DT 
sale NN 
of IN 
any , 
crops IN 
in IN 
California NNS 
that IN 
do IN 
n't IN 
meet IN 
the NNS 
initiative IN 
's NNS 
standards NNP

Kansas IN 
wheat IN 
farmers IN 
and IN 
Florida IN 
fruit IN 
growers IN 
would IN 
have IN 
to IN 
adjust NNS 
or IN 
give IN 
up IN 
the NNS 
California IN 
market NNP 
. . 

In IN 
other IN 
words IN 
, , 
California NNS 
is IN 
presuming IN 
to IN 
take , 
control IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
nation IN 
's NNS 
farm NNS 
policy NNP 
. . 

As IN 
usual IN 
the NNS 
green IN 
lobby NNP 
's NNS 
proposal NNS 
is IN 
disconnected IN 
from IN 
scientific IN 
reality NNP 
. . 

Consider IN 
the DT 
greenhouse-effect IN 
provision NNP 
. . 

The IN 
proposed IN 
initiative IN 
would IN 
mandate IN 
a DT 
reduction IN 
of IN 
carbon DT 
dioxide IN 
of IN 
40 VBZ 
% IN 
. . 

Even IN 
if IN 
one IN 
buys IN 
into IN 
the NNS 
whole IN 
greenhouse IN 
theory IN 
, , 
it NNS 
is IN 
inconceivable IN 
that IN 
reductions IN 
in IN 
a NNS 
single IN 
state IN 
could IN 
have IN 
any IN 
impact IN 
on IN 
what IN 
is IN 
billed IN 
as IN 
a IN 
global IN 
problem NNP 
. . 

But IN 
if IN 
rational IN 
science IN 
and IN 
economics IN 
have IN 
nothing IN 
to IN 
do NNS 
with , 
the NNS 
new IN 
environment IN 
initiative IN 
, , 
what NNS 
is IN 
going IN 
on IN 
? . 

The IN 
first IN 
place IN 
to IN 
look NNS 
under IN 
these IN 
circumstances IN 
is IN 
at IN 
the NNS 
ways IN 
in IN 
which , 
the DT 
sponsors IN 
themselves IN 
will IN 
benefit NNP 
. . 

The IN 
key IN 
here IN 
is IN 
the DT 
ambition NN 
of IN 
state IN 
Attorney IN 
General IN 
John IN 
Van IN 
de IN 
Kamp NNP 
. . 

He NNP 
's IN 
running NNS 
for IN 
governor NNP 
. . 

Mr. IN 
Van IN 
de IN 
Kamp IN 
is IN 
the NNS 
one IN 
who IN 
collected IN 
the NNS 
plans IN 
from IN 
the NNS 
various IN 
radical IN 
environmental IN 
groups IN 
and IN 
cobbled IN 
them IN 
into IN 
a IN 
single IN 
unwieldy IN 
initiative IN 
to IN 
be NNS 
placed IN 
on IN 
the NNS 
ballot IN 
for IN 
election IN 
on IN 
Nov. IN 
6 IN 
, NNS 
1990 . 
. . 

That NNP 
's IN 
also , 
the DT 
day NN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
gubernatorial IN 
election NNP 
. . 

The IN 
initiative IN 
seems IN 
to IN 
have NNS 
been DT 
crafted IN 
to IN 
include NNS 
all , 
the NNS 
hot IN 
issues IN 
that IN 
set IN 
off IN 
the NNS 
wealthy IN 
Hollywood IN 
weepers IN 
who IN 
donate IN 
money NNP

And IN 
it IN 
allows IN 
Mr. IN 
Van IN 
de IN 
Kamp IN 
to IN 
get NNS 
around IN 
campaign IN 
spending IN 
limits NNP

He IN 
can IN 
spend IN 
the NNS

possible IN 
that IN

be IN 
ruled IN 
unconstitutional IN

it DT 
is IN 
of IN 
course IN 
conceivable DT 
that IN 
in IN 
modern NNS 
California IN 
it IN

slide IN

This IN

the NNS 
state IN

If IN 
this IN

the NNS

The IN

creates IN 
a IN

sue NNS 
companies IN 
or IN 
government IN 
agencies IN 
that IN 
do IN 
things IN 
he IN 
does IN

like NNP

That IN 
means IN 
the NNS 
NRDC IN

such IN 
groups IN 
no IN

Mr. IN

be IN

some IN

segments IN

political NNS 
and IN

may IN 
yet IN 
start IN

out IN 
that IN

The IN

for IN

to NNS 
the NNS

The IN

quick IN 
27-point IN

to IN 
many NNS

it IN 
looked IN 
as IN 
if IN

headed IN 
for IN

another IN 
big IN 
tumble NNP

More IN

There IN 
was IN 
heavy NNS 
stock-index IN

The DT

dashed IN 
any IN

hold IN

losing NNS 
63.52 IN

the NNS 
first IN 
40 DT 
minutes IN

With IN 
program IN 
traders IN 
seemingly IN 
in IN 
charge , 
, , 
buyers NNS 
backed IN 
away IN 
from IN 
the NNS

watched IN

fall NNP

Then IN 
at IN 
10:15 , 
the DT 
Dow IN 
suddenly IN 
started IN 
to IN 
rebound ,

and NNS 
when IN 
it IN 
shot IN 
upward IN 
it IN 
did IN 
so IN 
even IN 
faster IN 
than IN 
the NNS 
early-morning IN 
fall NNP

And IN 
this IN 
time IN 
, , 
it IN 
was IN

just IN 
the NNS 
program IN

who IN 
were IN

All IN 
the DT

A IN 
House-Senate IN

a IN

The IN

allowed IN 
on IN

Hawaii IN 
appears IN 
to IN 
be NNS 
largely IN 
a IN

for IN 
the NNS

which NNS

By IN

the DT 
six-hour IN

As IN 
a IN 
practical IN 
matter IN 
, , 
flights NNS 
from IN

West IN

be IN 
covered IN 
as IN 
they IN

the IN

Within IN 
the DT 
Senate IN

the NNS

Sen. IN 
Frank IN

( NNS 
D. ,

who IN

a IN 
Senate IN 
Appropriations IN

chairman IN 
to IN 
garner NNS 
votes IN 
for IN

From IN

tobacco IN

has IN 
been IN 
uncertain IN

what ,

the NNS

Until IN

At IN

Slated IN

by IN 
the DT

the DT

`` IN

The IN

International IN

Why IN 
all IN

For IN

who IN 
grew IN 
up IN 
being IN

black NNS

`` IN 
It DT

'' NNS 
he IN 
adds NNP

Such IN

have IN 
been IN

attractive IN 
to IN 
professional NNS

says NNS 
Gap IN

which NNS

Companies IN

Portrait IN

have IN 
also IN 
latched IN

the DT 
trend .

Using IN

, , 
`` VBN 
we NNS 
can IN 
make IN

John NNP 
Perrin NNP

His IN 
On-Broadway IN 
Photography IN 
studio IN 
in IN 
Portland , 
, NNP 
Ore. , 
, IN 
doubled NNS 
its IN 
business IN 
last IN 
year IN 
and IN 
, , 
he NNS 
says IN 
, , 
is NNS 
booked IN 
solid IN 
for IN 
the NNS 
next IN 
five NNP 
. . 

One IN 
customer IN 
, , 
Dayna NNS 
Brunsdon IN 
, , 
says NNS 
she IN 
spurned IN 
a IN 
color IN 
portrait IN 
for IN 
black IN 
and IN 
white IN 
because IN 
`` IN 
it , 
's NNS 
more NNS 
dramatic NNP

I IN 
show IN 
it IN 
to IN 
my NNS 
friends IN 
, , 
and NNS 
they IN 
all IN 
say IN 
` IN 
wow IN 
. . 
' . 

It IN 
is IN 
n't IN 
ordinary IN 
like IN 
color DT

'' . 

Still IN 
, IN 
most NNS 
consumers IN 
are IN 
n't IN 
plunking IN 
black-and-white IN 
film IN 
into IN 
their IN 
cameras IN 
to IN 
take NNS 
family IN 
snapshots NNP 
. . 

One IN 
big IN 
obstacle IN 
is IN 
that IN 
few IN 
drugstores IN 
develop IN 
the NNS 
film IN 
anymore NNP 
. . 

Typically IN 
, IN 
it NNS 
must IN 
be IN 
mailed IN 
to IN 
a , 
handful IN 
of IN 
processors IN 
and IN 
may IN 
take IN 
a IN 
week IN 
or IN 
more IN 
to IN 
be NNS 
processed IN 
and IN 
returned NNP 
. . 

Black-and-white IN 
film IN 
costs IN 
consumers IN 
a IN 
little IN 
less IN 
than IN 
color IN 
film IN 
, , 
and NNS 
processing IN 
costs IN 
the DT 
same . 
. . 

But IN 
for IN 
photofinishers IN 
, , 
developing NNS 
costs IN 
for IN 
black-and-white IN 
film IN 
are IN 
higher NNP 
. . 

Some IN 
companies IN 
are IN 
starting IN 
to IN 
tackle NNS 
that IN 
problem NNP 
. . 

Ilford IN 
, IN 
for NNS 
example IN 
, , 
recently NNS 
introduced IN 
a IN 
black-and-white IN 
film IN 
that IN 
can IN 
be IN 
processed DT 
quickly IN 
by IN 
color IN 
labs NNP 
. . 

Intent IN 
on IN 
wooing IN 
customers IN 
, , 
the NNS 
company IN 
is IN 
also IN 
increasing IN 
its DT 
sponsorship IN 
of IN 
black-and-white IN 
photography IN 
classes NNP 
. . 

Similarly IN 
, IN 
Agfa NNS 
is IN 
sponsoring DT 
scores IN 
of IN 
photography . 
contests IN 
at IN 
high NNS 
schools IN 
and IN 
colleges IN 
, , 
offering NNS 
free IN 
black-and-white IN 
film IN 
and IN 
paper IN 
as IN 
prizes NNP 
. . 

And IN 
Kodak IN 
is IN 
distributing IN 
an IN 
instructional VBN 
video IN 
to IN 
processors NNS 
on DT 
how IN 
to IN 
develop NNS 
its IN 
monochrome IN 
film IN 
more IN 
efficiently NNP 
. . 

Other IN 
companies IN 
are IN 
introducing IN 
related IN 
products NNP 
. . 

Charles IN 
Beseler IN 
Co. IN 
, , 
a NNS 
leading DT 
maker IN 
of IN 
photographic IN 
enlargers IN

introduced NNS 
last IN

a IN 
complete IN 
darkroom IN 
starter IN 
kit IN 
targeted IN 
at IN 
teen-agers NNS 
who IN 
want IN 
to IN 
process NNS 
their IN 
own IN 
black-and-white IN

The IN 
kit IN

which NNS 
has IN 
a IN 
suggested IN

price IN 
of IN 
$ IN 
250 IN 
and IN 
has IN 
already IN 
become IN 
a IN

Ian NNP 
Brightman IN 
, , 
Beseler NNP 
's IN 
chairman NNS 
and IN 
chief IN 
executive IN 
officer NNP 
. . 

But IN 
some IN 
industry IN 
observers IN 
believe IN 
the DT 
resurgence NN 
of IN 
black IN 
and IN 
white IN 
is IN 
only IN 
a IN 
fad NNP

They IN 
cite IN 
the DT 
emergence NN 
of IN 
still IN 
electronic IN 
photography IN 
, , 
more NNS 
newspapers IN 
turning IN 
to IN 
color NNS 
on IN 
their IN 
pages IN 
and IN 
measurable IN 
improvements IN 
in IN 
the DT 
quality , 
of IN 
color VBZ 
prints IN

`` IN 
Black DT

made IN 
the NNS

leaps IN

'' NNS 
says IN 
Mr. NNP

the NNS

The IN

in IN 
July NNS

215.3 IN 
as IN 
recently IN

The IN

the NNS 
fifth IN

which NNS 
uses IN 
the NNS

this IN

Its IN 
ragged IN 
behavior IN 
through DT 
much IN 
of IN 
1989 IN 
has IN 
prompted IN 
some IN

the DT

perhaps IN 
before IN

But IN 
the DT

stronger DT

`` IN

seems IN 
likely NNP

`` IN 
No DT

shows IN 
no DT

off IN

tracks NN 
, , 
'' NNS 
Mr. IN

reports NNP

Based IN 
largely IN 
on IN 
the NNS 
recent DT 
strength IN 
in IN 
their NNP 
index IN 
, IN 
called , 
the IN 
long IN

the NNS

foresee IN

the DT 
rest NN 
of IN 
this IN

next IN

as IN

They IN

in IN 
the NNS 
gross IN 
national IN

, , 
after NNS 
adjustment IN 
for IN

Underlying IN 
this IN 
optimism IN 
is IN 
the NNS 
index IN

longstanding NNS 
ability IN 
to IN 
signal NNS 
recessions IN 
or IN 
recoveries IN 
, IN 
as , 
the IN 
case IN 
may IN 
be NNP 
, , 
by NNS 
substantially IN 
greater IN

the NNS 
Commerce IN

index ,

Over IN

II IN

, , 
the NNS 
Columbia IN

, IN 
on ,

entered IN 
sustained IN

14 IN

turned IN 
up IN

10 IN

only IN 
three IN

The IN 
Columbia IN

also IN 
have IN 
reconstructed IN 
how IN 
the NNS

would IN 
have IN

had NNS 
it IN 
existed IN 
, VBN

that VBP

Great IN

The IN

reached IN 
a IN 
peak IN 
in IN 
January NNS 
1929 IN

then IN 
fell IN 
steadily IN 
up IN

`` IN

'' NNS 
Mr. IN

A IN 
major DT 
source IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
recent DT

in IN

been IN 
the DT

is IN 
the NNS

Mr. IN

One IN

Peter DT 
Cardillo IN 
of IN 
Josephthal ,

, , 
New NNS

, IN 
said , 
the IN 
gold IN 
market IN 
already IN 
had IN 
some IN 
good IN 
price-supporting IN 
technical IN 
factors IN 
that IN 
would IN 
have IN 
caused IN 
prices IN 
to IN 
rise , 
, , 
with NNS 
or IN 
without IN 
the NNS 
stock IN 
market NNP 
. . 

`` IN 
What DT 
the IN 
stock IN 
market IN 
did IN 
was IN 
cause , 
the DT 
rise IN 
to IN 
take NNS 
place IN 
earlier IN 
than IN 
it IN 
would IN 
have IN 
happened IN 
, , 
'' NNS 
said IN 
Mr. NNP 
Cardillo NNP 
. . 

There NNP 
's IN 
a NNS 
good IN 
chance IN 
that IN 
gold IN 
will IN 
retain IN 
its IN 
gains IN 
and IN 
rise IN 
further IN 
, , 
he NNS 
said NNP 
. . 

He IN 
expects IN 
a IN 
drop IN 
in IN 
interest NNP 
rates IN 
, , 
which NNS 
would IN 
help DT 
gold IN 
by IN 
keeping , 
the IN 
dollar IN 
from IN 
rising NNP 
. . 

Finally IN 
, DT 
according IN 
to IN 
Mr. NNS 
Cardillo NNP 
, , 
the DT 
impact IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
strong IN 
dollar IN 
should IN 
be IN 
reflected IN 
in IN 
reduced NNS 
exports IN 
in IN

August IN 
merchandise IN 
trade IN 
deficit IN 
, IN 
when , 
the IN 
figures IN 
are IN 
released IN 
today NNP

This IN 
would IN 
be IN 
damaging IN 
to IN 
the NNS

supportive IN 
for IN

ENERGY IN 
: NNP 

Worried IN 
that IN 
Friday NNP 
's NNS 
190-point NNS 
stock IN 
market IN 
plunge IN 
might IN 
be IN 
a DT 
harbinger IN 
of IN 
things , 
to IN 
come NNS 
for , 
the NNS 
economy IN 
, IN 
petroleum NNS 
futures IN 
traders IN 
called IN 
a IN 
halt IN 
to IN 
the NNS 
recent DT 
string IN 
of IN 
increases VBN 
in IN 
crude NNS 
oil IN

The IN

November IN

, , 
down NNS 
30 IN 
cents NNP 
. . 

Some IN 
analysts IN 
said IN 
crude IN 
was IN 
due NNS 
for IN 
a IN 
correction IN 
anyhow IN 
, , 
following NNS 
several DT 
days IN 
of IN 
significant VBZ 
gains IN 
. . 

But IN 
most IN 
market IN 
observers IN 
agreed IN 
that IN 
Friday NNP 
's NNS 
stock NNS 
market IN 
drop IN 
is IN 
what IN 
dampened IN 
spirits IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
petroleum IN 
pits IN 
yesterday NNP 
. . 

Until IN 
yesterday IN 
, , 
futures NNS 
prices IN 
had IN 
been IN 
headed IN 
up IN 
on IN 
expectations IN 
that IN 
world IN 
oil IN 
demand IN 
will IN 
continue IN 
to IN 
be NNS 
strong NNP 
. . 

The DT 
Organization IN 
of IN 
Petroleum IN 
Exporting IN 
Countries IN 
increased IN 
its IN 
production IN 
ceiling IN 
for IN 
the NNS 
fourth IN 
quarter IN 
based IN 
on DT 
projections IN 
of IN 
robust VBZ 
demand IN 
. . 

So IN 
any IN 
bearish IN 
indicator IN 
, , 
such NNS 
as IN 
Friday NNP 
's NNS 
precipitous NNS 
drop IN 
in IN 
the NNS

sends NNS 
shivers IN 
through IN 
the NNS

Indeed IN 
, IN

early IN 
in IN 
the NNS

day IN 
to IN 
Friday ,

plummet , 
, , 
futures NNS

firmed IN

partial NNS 
recovery IN 
yesterday NNP

But IN 
the DT

, IN 
panic NNS

sweep IN 
the NNS 
world IN

, , 
and NNS 
investors IN 
large IN

seemed IN 
to IN 
accept , 
Friday NNP

dizzying NNS 
190-point IN 
plunge IN 
as IN 
a IN 
sharp IN 
correction IN 
, , 
not NNS

Many IN 
went IN 
bargain-hunting NNP

Among IN

relief IN 
was IN 
John NNS

to IN 
monitor , 
yesterday NNP

As IN

strength IN 
at IN 
3:15 NNP 
p.m. IN

he NNS 
smiled IN 
broadly IN

Stanley IN

his NNS 
top IN

, IN 
on , 
the DT

At IN

it NNS 
seemed IN 
as IN 
if IN

repeat IN 
itself NNP

As IN

opened IN 
yesterday IN 
morning IN

the NNS 
Big IN 
Board IN 
, , 
stocks VBN 
of IN 
many , 
of IN 
the VBZ 
nation IN 
's NNS 
biggest NNS 
companies IN 
could IN 
n't IN 
open IN 
for IN 
trading IN 
because IN 
a DT 
wave IN 
of IN 
sell IN 
orders IN 
was IN 
overwhelming NNS 
buyers NNP 
. . 

By IN 
10:10 IN 
, , 
the NNS 
Dow IN 
Industrials IN 
were IN 
off IN 
63.52 IN 
points IN 
, IN 
and , 
the DT 
stock NN 
of IN 
UAL IN 
Corp. IN 
, , 
whose NNS 
troubles IN 
had IN 
kicked IN 
off IN 
Friday NNP 
's NNS 
plunge , 
, , 
still NNS 
had IN 
n't IN 
opened NNP 
. . 

But IN 
then IN 
, , 
as NNS 
quickly IN 
as IN 
the NNS 
Dow IN 
had IN 
fallen IN 
, , 
it VBN 
began IN 
to IN 
turn NNS 
around NNP 
. . 

It IN 
ended IN 
with IN 
a DT 
gain IN 
of IN 
88.12 VBZ 
points IN 
. . 

By IN 
the DT 
market IN 
's NNP 
close , 
, , 
volume NNS 
on IN 
the NNS 
New IN

totaled IN 
more IN 
than IN 
416 IN 
million IN 
, , 
the NNS 
fourth IN 
highest IN 
on IN

The IN 
Big IN

handled IN 
the NNS 
huge IN 
volume IN 
without IN 
any IN 
obvious IN 
strain IN 
, VBN 
in NNS 
sharp IN 
contrast IN 
to IN 
Black , 
Monday IN 
of IN 
1987 .

But IN 
the DT 
rally IN 
was IN 
largely VBN 
confined IN 
to IN 
the NNS 
blue-chip NNS 
stocks IN 
, , 
which NNS 
had IN 
been IN 
hard IN 
hit IN 
during IN 
Friday NNP 
's NNS 
selling NNS 
frenzy NNP 
. . 

Overall IN 
, IN 
more NNS 
Big IN 
Board IN 
stocks IN 
lost IN 
money IN 
than IN 
gained NNP 
. . 

And IN 
many IN 
arbitragers IN 
, , 
already NNS 
reeling IN 
from IN 
Friday NNP 
's NN 
collapse , 
of IN 
the VBZ 
UAL IN 
deal IN 
, , 
were NNS 
further IN 
hurt IN 
yesterday IN 
when IN 
a IN 
proposed DT 
takeover IN 
of IN 
AMR IN 
Corp. IN 
, , 
the DT 
parent IN 
of IN 
American IN 
Airlines IN 
, NNS 
collapsed .

Indeed IN 
, , 
the NNS 
Dow IN 
Jones IN 
Transportation IN 
Average IN 
plunged IN 
102.06 IN 
points IN 
, , 
its NNS 
second-worst IN 
drop IN 
in IN 
history NNP

World-wide IN 
, IN 
trading IN 
was IN 
generally NNS 
manageable NNP

The IN 
Frankfurt IN 
stock IN 
exchange IN 
was IN 
hardest DT 
hit IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
major IN 
markets IN 
, , 
with NNS 
blue IN 
chips IN 
there IN 
falling IN 
12.8 IN 
% NNP

In IN 
London IN 
, IN 
a NNS 
midday IN 
rally IN 
left IN 
the NNS 
market IN

off IN 
3.2 IN

and NNS 
Tokyo IN

fell IN 
only IN 
1.8 IN

more NNS

there IN 
were IN 
no IN 
free-fall IN

Investors IN 
big IN

say IN 
they IN 
learned IN 
valuable IN 
lessons IN 
since IN 
the NNS 
1987 IN 
crash IN 
: IN 
In IN 
this DT 
age IN

in IN 
a NNS 
few IN

must IN 
be IN 
expected NNP

What NNP 
's NNP 
more , 
, , 
such NNS 
short-term IN

Many IN 
other NNP 
factors , 
played NNS 
a NNS 
part IN 
in IN 
yesterday NNP 
's NNS 
comeback NNP 
. . 

The IN 
Federal IN 
Reserve IN 
signaled IN 
its IN 
willingness IN 
to IN 
provide NNS 
liquidity IN 
; IN 
the NNS 
interest IN 
rate IN 
on IN 
its IN 
loans IN 
to IN 
major NNS 
banks IN 
inched IN 
downward IN 
early IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
day . 
. . 

Foreign IN 
stock IN 
markets IN 
, , 
which NNS 
kicked IN 
off IN 
Black IN 
Monday IN 
with IN 
a IN 
huge IN 
selling IN 
spree IN 
, IN 
began , 
the IN 
day DT 
off IN 
by IN 
relatively IN 
modest IN 
amounts NNP

The IN 
dollar IN 
, NNS 
after NNS 
falling IN 
sharply IN 
in IN 
overnight NNS 
trading IN 
to IN 
139.10 NNS 
yen IN 
, , 
bounced NNS 
back IN 
strongly IN 
to IN 
141.8 , 
, , 
thus NNS 
easing IN 
fears IN 
that IN 
foreigners IN 
would IN 
unload IN 
U.S. IN 
stocks NNP 
. . 

And IN 
the DT 
widely IN 
disseminated IN 
opinion IN 
among IN 
most IN 
market IN 
experts IN 
that IN 
a IN 
crash IN 
was VBP 
n't VBN 
in IN 
store NNS 
also IN 
helped IN 
calm IN 
investors NNP 
. . 

Many IN 
major IN 
institutions IN 
, , 
for NNS 
example IN 
, , 
came NNS 
into IN 
work IN 
yesterday IN 
ready IN 
to IN 
buy , 
some IN 
of IN 
the VBZ 
blue IN 
chips IN 
they IN 
felt IN 
had IN 
been IN 
sharply IN 
undervalued IN 
on IN 
Friday NNP

Still IN 
, IN 
amid NNS 
all IN 
the NNS 
backslapping IN 
and DT 
signs IN 
of IN 
relief IN 
over IN 
yesterday NNP 
's NNS 
events , 
, , 
some NNS 
market IN 
professionals IN 
cautioned IN 
that IN 
there IN 
is IN 
nothing IN 
present IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
current IN 
market IN 
system IN 
to IN 
prevent NNS 
another IN 
dizzying IN 
drop IN 
such IN 
as IN 
Friday NNP 
's NNP

`` IN 
There DT 
is IN 
too IN 
much IN 
complacency IN 
, , 
'' NNS 
says IN 
money IN 
manager IN 
Barry IN 
Schrager NNP

Computers IN 
have IN 
increasingly IN 
connected IN 
securities IN 
markets IN 
world-wide IN 
, , 
so NNS 
that IN 
a IN 
buying IN 
or IN 
selling IN 
wave IN 
in IN 
one NNS 
market IN 
is IN 
often IN 
passed IN 
around IN 
the DT 
globe .

So IN 
investors IN 
everywhere IN 
nervously IN 
eyed IN 
yesterday NNP 
's NNS 
opening IN 
in IN 
Tokyo , 
, IN 
where , 
the IN 
Nikkei DT 
average IN 
of IN 
225 IN 
blue-chip IN 
stocks IN 
got IN 
off IN 
to IN 
a NNS 
rocky IN 
start NNP

The IN 
average IN 
plunged IN 
some IN 
600 IN 
points IN

or NNS 
1.7 IN 
% IN 
, VBN 
in NNS 
the NNS 
first IN 
20 DT 
minutes IN 
of IN 
trading .

But IN 
the DT 
selling IN 
wave IN 
had IN 
no IN 
conviction IN 
, IN 
and , 
the IN 
market IN 
first IN 
surged DT 
upward IN 
by IN 
200 IN 
points IN 
, , 
then NNS 
drifted IN 
lower IN 
, , 
closing NNS 
down IN

Unlike IN 
two IN 
years IN 
ago IN 
, , 
most VBN 
of IN

of IN 
the NNP

, IN 
one NNS 
Merrill IN

But IN 
analysts IN 
, , 
while NNS 
applauding IN 
the NNS 
acquisition IN 
, IN 
say NNS 
Applied IN 
's NNS 
chief NNS 
executive IN 
faces IN 
a IN 
tough IN 
challenge IN 
in IN 
integrating , 
the DT 
two IN 
companies NNP 
. . 

Barry IN 
Wright IN 
, , 
acquired VBN 
by IN 
Applied IN 
for IN 
$ IN 
147 IN 
million IN 
, , 
makes NNS 
computer-room IN 
equipment IN 
and IN 
vibration-control IN 
systems NNP 
. . 

The IN 
Watertown IN 
, NNP 
Mass. , 
, , 
company NNP 
's IN 
sales NNS 
have IN 
been IN 
dormant IN 
and IN 
its IN 
profits IN 
have IN 
dropped NNP

Last IN 
year NNP 
's NN 
earnings , 
of IN 
$ IN 
1.3 IN

including NNS 
$ IN 
815,000 IN

, , 
were NNS 
far IN 
below IN 
the NNS 
year-earlier IN 
$ IN 
8.4 IN 
million NNP

Besides IN 
spurring IN 
Barry IN 
Wright NNP 
's NNS 
sales , 
, , 
which NNS 
were IN 
$ IN 
201.7 IN 
million IN 
in IN 
1988 , 
, , 
Mr. NNS 
Sim IN 
must IN 
pare IN 
its IN 
costs IN 
and IN 
product IN 
line NNP 
. . 

`` IN 
The NNS 
question IN 
is IN 
how IN 
long IN 
it NNP 
's VBN 
going , 
to IN 
take NNS 
Barry DT 
Wright IN 
to IN 
make NNS 
a NNP 
contribution IN 
, , 
'' NNS 
says IN 
F. IN 
John IN 
Mirek NNP 
, IN 
an DT 
analyst , 
at IN 
Blunt NNS 
Ellis IN 
Loewi IN 
in IN 
Milwaukee NNP 
. . 

The IN 
answer IN 
will IN 
help IN 
determine IN 
whether IN 
Applied IN 
continues IN 
to IN 
reach , 
the DT 
ambitious IN 
goals IN 
set IN 
by IN 
Mr. IN 
Sim NNP 
. . 

The IN 
Butler IN 
, NNP 
Wis. , 
, IN 
manufacturer NNS 
went IN 
public IN 
at IN 
$ NNS 
15.75 IN 
a IN 
share IN 
in IN 
August NNP 
1987 IN 
, , 
and NNS 
Mr. IN 
Sim NNP 
's NNS 
goal NNS 
then IN 
was IN 
a NNS 
$ IN 
29 IN 
per-share DT 
price IN 
by IN 
1992 . 
. . 

Strong IN 
earnings IN 
growth IN 
helped IN 
achieve IN 
that IN 
price IN 
far DT 
ahead IN 
of IN 
schedule , 
, IN 
in NNS 
August NNS 
1988 NNP 
. . 

The IN 
stock IN 
has IN 
since IN 
softened IN 
, , 
trading NNS 
around IN 
$ IN 
25 IN 
a IN

last IN

closing IN 
yesterday IN 
at IN 
$ NNS 
23.00 IN 
in IN 
national NNS 
over-the-counter IN 
trading NNP 
. . 

But IN 
Mr. IN 
Sim IN 
has IN 
set IN 
a IN 
fresh DT 
target IN 
of IN 
$ IN 
50 IN 
a DT 
share IN 
by IN 
the DT 
end NN 
of IN 

Reaching IN 
that IN 
goal IN 
, , 
says NNS 
Robert IN 
T. IN 
Foote IN 
, , 
Applied NNP 
's IN 
chief NNS 
financial IN 
officer IN 
, , 
will IN 
require IN 
`` IN 
efficient DT 
reinvestment DT 
'' IN 
of IN 
cash , 
by IN 
Applied IN 
and NNP 
continuation IN 
of IN 
its DT 
healthy IN 
19 IN 
% NNS 
rate IN 
of IN 
return IN 
on IN 
operating IN 
capital NNP 
. . 

In IN 
Barry IN 
Wright IN 
, , 
Mr. NNS 
Sim IN 
sees IN 
a IN 
situation IN 
`` IN 
very DT 
similar IN 
'' IN 
to IN 
the NNS 
one NNS 
he IN 
faced IN 
when IN 
he IN 
joined IN 
Applied IN 
as IN 
president IN 
and IN 
chief IN 
operating IN 
officer IN 
in IN 
1985 NNP 
. . 

Applied IN 
, IN 
then NNS 
a IN 
closely IN 
held IN 
company IN 
, , 
was NNS 
stagnating IN 
under IN 
the DT 
management NN 
of IN 
its IN 
controlling IN 
family NNP 
. . 

While IN 
profitable IN 
, NNP 
it IN 
`` IN 
was NNS 
n't NNS 
growing IN 
and IN 
was IN 
n't NNS 
providing IN 
a IN 
satisfactory IN 
return IN 
on IN 
invested IN 
capital IN 
, , 
'' NNS 
he IN 
says NNP 
. . 

Mr. IN 
Sim IN 
is IN 
confident IN 
that IN 
the DT 
drive IN 
to IN 
dominate NNS 
certain IN 
niche IN 
markets IN 
will IN 
work IN 
at IN 
Barry NNS 
Wright IN 
as IN 
it IN 
has IN 
at IN 
Applied . 
. . 

He IN 
also IN 
professes IN 
an IN 
`` VBN 
evangelical DT 
'' IN 
fervor IN 
to IN 
develop NNS 
a IN 
corporate IN 
culture IN 
that IN 
rewards IN 
managers IN 
who IN 
produce IN 
and IN 
where IN 
decision-making IN 
is IN 
shared NNP 
. . 

Mr. IN 
Sim IN 
considers IN 
the NNS 
new IN 
unit NNP 
's NNP 
operations , 
`` IN 
fundamentally DT 
sound IN 
'' IN 
and IN 
adds IN 
that IN 
Barry IN 
Wright IN 
has IN 
been IN 
fairly IN 
successful IN 
in IN 
moving NNS 
into IN 
markets IN 
that IN 
have IN 
n't IN 
interested IN 
larger IN 
competitors NNP 
. . 

`` IN 
With DT 
a IN 
little IN 
patience IN 
, , 
these NNS 
businesses IN 
will IN 
perform IN 
very IN 
satisfactorily IN 
, , 
'' NNS 
Mr. IN 
Sim NNP 
says NNP 
. . 

Within IN 
about IN 
six IN 
months NNP 
, , 
`` VBN 
things NNS 
will IN 
be IN 
moving IN 
in IN 
the NNS 
right IN 
direction NNP 
, , 
'' NNS 
he IN 
predicts NNP 
. . 

Mr. IN 
Sim IN 
figures IN 
it IN 
will IN 
be IN 
easier IN 
to IN 
turn NNS 
Barry IN 
Wright IN 
around IN 
since IN 
he NNP 
's NNS 
now . 
in IN 
the NNS 
driver IN 
's NNS 
seat NNP 
. . 

When IN 
he IN 
came IN 
to IN 
Applied NNP 
, , 
`` VBN 
I NNS 
did IN 
n't IN 
have IN 
the DT 
power IN 
to IN 
execute NNS 
as IN 
I IN 
do IN 
today IN 
, , 
'' NNS 
he IN 
says NNP 
. . 

He IN 
was IN 
named NNS 
chief IN 
executive DT 
officer IN 
of IN 
Applied VBN 
in IN 
1986 NNS 
and IN 
became IN 
chairman IN 
last IN 
November NNP 
. . 

At IN 
Applied IN 
, , 
Mr. NNS 
Sim IN 
set IN 
growth IN 
as IN 
his IN 
first IN 
objective NNP 
. . 

He IN 
took IN 
the NNS 
company DT 
public IN 
in IN 
an NNS 
offering IN 
that IN 
netted IN 
Applied IN 
about IN 
$ IN 
12.6 IN 
million IN 
, , 
which NNS 
helped IN 
launch IN 
the NNS 
company IN 
's NNS 
acquisition NNS 
program NNP 
. . 

Sales IN 
climbed IN 
to IN 
an NNS 
estimated IN 
$ IN 
245 IN 
million IN 
in IN 
fiscal NNP 
1989 IN 
, , 
ended NNS 
Aug. IN 
31 IN 
, , 
from NNS 
$ IN 
99.9 IN 
million IN 
in IN 
fiscal NNS 
1985 NNP 
. . 

The IN 
company IN 
expects IN 
that IN 
earnings IN 
, , 
which NNS 
have IN 
marched IN 
steadily IN 
upward IN 
in IN 
recent NNP 
years IN 
, , 
reached NNS
