Considerations:
- There were words that appeared in the dev data but not in the train data,
we figured it out with adding to the train data the 'UUUNKKK' word. Every word in the dev data that didn't have a representation
in the embedding matrix, was represented as an 'UUUNKKK' word.
In order to learn the behaviour of unknown words, we decided to treat every word that appeared in the train data less than x times
(x value was set to 5) .
To improve this we distinguished between four types of unknown words:
* all capitals (UNK_ALLCAP)
* capital first letter (UNK_CapStart)
* number (UNK_num)
* all other unknown words (UUUNKKK)

Each type received a vector and unknown words were mapped to their correct vector by checking these features

- To deal with the vectors in places (-2,-1) and (+1,+2) for the first and last words in the sequence.
We added 4 vectors to the E matrix [/S/S], [/S], [/E], [/E/E] that represented those places.
