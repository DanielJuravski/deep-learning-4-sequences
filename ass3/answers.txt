• Can the two languages be distinguished using a bag-of-words approach?
Explain why.

bag of words can accept an input of inconsistent length but does not maintain its order
therefore would fail to recognize the convention

• Can the two languages be distinguished using a bigram or trigram based
approach? Explain why.
for any ngram we choose the sequence of digits can be larger, having it larger then our
ngram window will prevent our network from recognizing the rules here


• Can the two languages be distinguished using a convolutional neural network?
Explain why.

cnn requires a fixed length for the input
