• Can the two languages be distinguished using a bag-of-words approach?
Explain why.

Bag of words can accept an input of inconsistent length but does not maintain its order
therefore would fail to recognize the convention.

• Can the two languages be distinguished using a bigram or trigram based
approach? Explain why.
For any ngram we choose, the sequence of digits can be larger than that chosen n, having it larger than our
ngram window will prevent our network from recognizing the rules here, becahus the order of the letters would be
out the window's boundries and without memory there would be no way for the model to distinguish between a positive
and a negative example.


• Can the two languages be distinguished using a convolutional neural network?
Explain why.

Cnn requires fixed length for the input, and since the strings are of variant length any window size we choose
as the fixed input size, can be too small to capture the phenomena without memory.
